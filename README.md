The objective of the project was to analyze the churn data set and find out the factors that causing the customers to leave the organizations.

Insights from Customer Retention Data Analysis:

Customers with month-to-month contract type are more likely to churn (~89%).

Out of 1869 churned customers, 476 senior citizens have left the company (~25%).

Customers within 20 months tenure are more likely to leave(~43%).

Suggestions to retain customers:

Encourage customers with month-to-month contract type to subscribe to long term contracts such as yearly or bi-yearly by giving attractive coupons/offers
as it is evident from the analysis that the contract type is an important factor as ~89% month-to-month contract type customers are more likely to leave.
These customers are free to go anytime as they are not having any contract.
Reach out to senior citizens and ask them about their pain points and act accordingly.
Target customers who are within 20 months tenure. Provide them excellent customer service to build trust and strong relationships. Recommend them services that might help them.
